One takes its starting point in the subjective experience of the mathematician and characterises mathematical beauty in cognitive terms. The other seeks to reduce beauty to objective notions such as truth, symmetry, or simplicity. This second approach is popular among analytic philosophers, who are committed to seeing mathematics and science as prototypically rational enterprises. I criticise this stance on the grounds that this commitment makes its supporters approach beauty in mathematics not with a genuine desire to sympathetically understand it, but with the preconceived goal of explaining it away and playing it down.},

But how, exactly, should we conceive of the character of beauty in mathematics? In this paper I suggest that Kant's philosophy provides the resources for a compelling answer to this question. Focusing on §62 of the 'Critique of Aesthetic Judgment', I argue against the common view that Kant's aesthetics leaves no room for beauty in mathematics. More specifically, I show that on the Kantian account beauty in mathematics is a non-conceptual response felt in light of our own creative activities involved in the process of mathematical reasoning. The Kantian proposal I thus develop provides a promising alternative to Platonist accounts of beauty widespread among mathematicians. While on the Platonist conception the experience of mathematical beauty consists in an intellectual insight into the fundamental structures of the universe, according to the Kantian proposal the experience of beauty in mathematics is grounded in our felt awareness of the imaginative processes that lead to mathematical knowledge. The Kantian account I develop thus offers to elucidate the connection between aesthetic reflection, creative imagination and mathematical cognition.},

In this paper we reflect on the contribution that the so-called hypothetico-deductive method, with a particular focus on experimental studies, can make to our understanding of mathematical practice. By way of illustration, we report an experiment that investigated how mathematicians attribute aesthetic properties to mathematical proofs. We demonstrate that perceptions of the aesthetic properties of mathematical proofs are, in some cases at least, subject to social influence. Specifically, we show that mathematicians’ aesthetic judgements tend to conform to the judgements made by others. Pedagogical implications are discussed.},

  abstract   = {Theories are often praised for their simplicity, elegance, and beauty. But can aesthetic judgments properly enter the evaluation of theories? Or are aesthetic values irrelevant when it comes to assessing whether a theory is true? In Judgments of Beauty in Theory Evaluation, Devon Brickhouse-Bryson addresses these questions, offering a defence of judgments of beauty in the evaluation of theories. He takes the reader beyond the discussion of aesthetic values in science to consider the connection between the beauty and the truth of a theory more generally, drawing on debates in aesthetics and metaphilosophy to do so. The book is clearly written and accessible for researchers new to the topic and presents an exciting and nuanced contribution to a growing literature. In what follows, I will summarize the chapters of the book, noting some points of criticism as well as possible avenues for further exploration along the way. Aside from providing an overview of the chapters, the introduction explains the need for “indirect” methods of theory evaluation since the truth of a theory cannot be assessed directly. This leads to the statement of the central thesis of the book: Theories are “systems of thought” and should be evaluated as such. As BrickhouseBryson states, “A system is a good system if it is, for example, simpler, more unified, more economical, more coherent, more elegant, etc.” (xix). In other words, good theories, understood as systems, are beautiful. Chapter 1 addresses the claim that beauty is relative or, as it is commonly expressed, is “in the eye of the beholder”. If this were true, Brickhouse-Bryson argues, then the overall project would be undermined; truth is not relative, and hence, the connection between a theory’s beauty and its truth is implausible. Brickhouse-Bryson sketches out various possible understandings of this perspective but ultimately argues, via an analogy with moral relativism, that, however understood, relativism results in problematic implications.},

                Those who wish to defend the role of aesthetic values in science face a dilemma: Aesthetic language is either used metaphorically for what are ultimately epistemic features, or it is used literally, but the importance of such values for science are unclear. This paper introduces a new account that gets around this problem by looking to an overlooked source of aesthetic value in science: the relation between form and content. A fit between the content of a thought experiment, and the way in which that content is formulated, can have important epistemic pay offs through contributing to scientific understanding.},

As examples, judgments involving criteria such as simplicity and symmetry are often cited. However, other theory selection criteria, such as fecundity, coherence, internal consistency, and fertility, more closely match those criteria used in art contexts and by scholars working in aesthetics. Paying closer attention to the way these criteria are used in art contexts allows us to understand some evaluative and developmental practices in scientific theory selection as genuinely aesthetic, enlarging the scope of the goals of science.},

              Mathematicians often conduct aesthetic judgements to evaluate mathematical objects such as equations or proofs. But is there a consensus about which mathematical objects are beautiful? We used a comparative judgement technique to measure aesthetic intuitions among British mathematicians, Chinese mathematicians, and British mathematics undergraduates, with the aim of assessing whether judgements of mathematical beauty are influenced by cultural differences or levels of expertise. We found aesthetic agreement both within and across these demographic groups. We conclude that judgements of mathematical beauty are not strongly influenced by cultural difference, levels of expertise, and types of mathematical objects. Our findings contrast with recent studies that found mathematicians often disagree with each other about mathematical beauty.},

This article provides a pragmatic analysis of the roles of the aesthetic in mathematical inquiry. It then probes some of the beliefs and values that underlie mathematical aesthetic responses and reveals the important interplay between the aesthetic, cognitive, and affective processes involved in mathematical inquiry.},

                It argues that, in making aesthetic judgements, mathematicians may be responding to a combination of perceptual properties of visual representations and mathematical properties of abstract structures; the latter seem to carry greater weight. Mathematical beauty thus primarily involves mathematicians' sensitivity to aesthetics of the abstract.},

I claim that the best current explanation of this role, McAllister's ‘aesthetic induction’ model, fails to demonstrate that the judgements at issue are genuinely aesthetic.

According to Kant’s Critique of the Power of Judgment, satisfaction in beauty is subjective and non-conceptual, yet a proof can be beautiful even though it relies on concepts. I propose that, much like art creation, the formulation and study of a complex demonstration involves multiple and progressive interactions between the freely original imagination and taste (that is, the aesthetic power of judgement). Such a proof is artistic insofar as it is guided by beauty, namely, the mere feeling about the imagination’s free lawfulness. The beauty in a proof’s process and the perfection in its completion together facilitate a transition from subjective to objective purposiveness, a transition that Kant himself does not address in the third Critique.},

The sensation of this tension varies in degree and facilitates aesthetic estimation in general. But in the special case where it comes to involve a sense of exceeding our imagination’s limit, we judge a magnitude to be mathematically sublime.

To determine this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image the activity in the brains of 15 mathematicians when they viewed mathematical formulae which they had individually rated as beautiful, indifferent or ugly. Results showed that the experience of mathematical beauty correlates parametrically with activity in the same part of the emotional brain, namely field A1 of the medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC), as the experience of beauty derived from other sources.},
